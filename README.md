this repo is meant only for learning and testing nest features and a recap on my next skills




npm run dev in root to run the project


the project needs 3 env variables 

1- DATABASE_URL

2- NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_UR

3- SESSION_SECRET_KEY


for 2 and 3 you can set whatever you want
for 3 if you dont know how to create a postgresql db you can connect me to provide a test url
